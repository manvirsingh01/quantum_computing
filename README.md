# SPDC Phase-Matching Simulation Tools

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to calculate phase-matching conditions for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) in various nonlinear optical crystals. These tools are essential for designing experiments that generate entangled photon pairs, a fundamental resource in quantum computing and quantum information science.

## Overview

Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion is a nonlinear optical process where a high-energy pump photon spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons, conventionally named the "signal" and "idler," inside a nonlinear crystal. For this process to occur efficiently, phase-matching conditions (which ensure momentum conservation) must be met.

This project provides scripts to calculate the required parameters—such as crystal angle, temperature, or poling period—to achieve phase-matching for different SPDC configurations.

## Features

- **Multiple SPDC Types:** Simulates conditions for Type-0, Type-I, and Type-II SPDC.
- **Various Phase-Matching Schemes:** Supports both Birefringent Phase-Matching (BPM) and Quasi-Phase-Matching (QPM), including temperature tuning.
- **Common Nonlinear Crystals:** Includes models for KDP, BBO, and periodically-poled KTP (PPKTP).
- **Key Parameter Calculation:**
  - Phase-matching angles ($\theta$).
  - Quasi-Phase-Matching grating periods ($\Lambda$).
  - Optimal crystal temperature for PPKTP.
  - Effective nonlinear coefficient ($d_{eff}$).

## Theoretical Background

### 1. Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)

SPDC is governed by the laws of energy and momentum conservation:

-   **Energy Conservation:** $\omega_p = \omega_s + \omega_i$
    (The pump photon frequency equals the sum of signal and idler frequencies).
-   **Momentum Conservation (Phase-Matching):** $\vec{k_p} = \vec{k_s} + \vec{k_i}$
    (The pump wavevector must equal the sum of the signal and idler wavevectors).

The phase-matching condition is crucial for constructive interference of the down-converted fields, leading to efficient photon pair generation.

### 2. Phase-Matching Techniques

-   **Birefringent Phase-Matching (BPM):** Achieved in birefringent crystals by carefully choosing the angle of the pump beam relative to the crystal's optical axis. This angle is used to tune the refractive indices "seen" by the differently polarized photons. Scripts `spdc_type_1.py` and `spdc_type_2.py` use this method.
-   **Quasi-Phase-Matching (QPM):** Achieved by periodically reversing the crystal's nonlinear coefficient, creating a grating structure. This introduces a grating vector, $\vec{K_g}$, to the momentum equation: $\vec{k_p} = \vec{k_s} + \vec{k_i} + \vec{K_g}$. Script `spdc_type_0.py` uses this method.

### 3. Temperature Tuning in QPM

In materials like Periodically-Poled KTP (PPKTP), the refractive indices are not only dependent on wavelength but also highly sensitive to temperature. This property can be exploited for phase-matching. Instead of changing the crystal angle, the temperature is varied to fine-tune the refractive indices. For a fixed pump wavelength and poling period ($\Lambda$), there is an optimal temperature at which the phase mismatch ($\Delta k$) is minimized. The `ppktp.py` script automates finding this temperature by minimizing the phase-mismatch equation using temperature-dependent Sellmeier equations.

### 4. SPDC Polarization Configurations

-   **Type-0:** The pump, signal, and idler photons all have the same polarization (e.g., e → e + e).
-   **Type-I:** The signal and idler photons have the same polarization, which is orthogonal to the pump (e.g., e → o + o).
-   **Type-II:** The signal and idler photons have orthogonal polarizations (e.g., e → o + e).

*(Note: 'e' denotes extraordinary polarization and 'o' denotes ordinary polarization.)*

## Prerequisites

The scripts require Python 3 and the following packages:

-   NumPy
-   SciPy
-   Pandas (only for `ppktp.py`)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/quantum_computing.git](https://github.com/your-username/quantum_computing.git)
    cd quantum_computing
    ```

2.  Install the required packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy pandas
    ```

## Usage

Each script can be run directly from the command line. The parameters (like pump wavelength) are hard-coded in the files but can be easily modified.
